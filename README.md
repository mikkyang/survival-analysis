# Survival Analysis

A *experimental* survival analysis library, initially inspired by Python's [lifelines](https://github.com/CamDavidsonPilon/lifelines).

Current Limitations:

* Only supports fitting to a Weibull distribution
* Only supports distributions that can be fitted with Nelder-Mean
* No autodifferentiation support
